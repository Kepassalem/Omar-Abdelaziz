            Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and
            primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers, with an estimated 88.9 percent total usage share
            on Web connected computers.[21][25][26][27] The latest version is Windows 10.
            Microsoft Windows was first released in 1985, as an operating environment running on top of MS-DOS, which
            was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In
            1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap.
            Server editions of Windows are widely used. In recent years, Microsoft has expended significant capital in
            an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system. However, Windows' usage on servers is
            not as widespread as on personal computers as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market
            share.

            The Linux kernel originated in 1991, as a project of Linus Torvalds, while a university student in Finland.
            He posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers, and received
            support and assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel.
            Many of the same computers are also on Green500 (but in different order), and Linux runs on the top 10.
            Linux is also commonly used on other small energy-efficient computers, such as smartphones and smartwatches.
            The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and
            Google's Android, Chrome OS, and Chromium OS.

    <div class="macOS">
        <p>
            macOS (formerly "Mac OS X" and later "OS X") is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed,
            marketed, and sold by Apple Inc., the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh
            computers. macOS is the successor to the original classic Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating
            system since 1984.
            Unlike its predecessor, macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT
            through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997. The operating
            system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0, followed in March 2001 by a client version (Mac OS
            X v10.0 "Cheetah"). Since then, six more distinct "client" and "server" editions of macOS have been
            released, until the two were merged in OS X 10.7 "Lion".
